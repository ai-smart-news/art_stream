        "prompt": "A woman with Medusa-like snakes in her hair, close-up portrait.  Hyperrealistic style, with painterly, impressionistic brushstrokes and texture.  The woman's face has a serious, intense expression, and her eyes are striking.  Her skin is a pale, muted tone with subtle freckles and streaks of dark, bloody texture.  The snakes are a mixture of muted grays, browns, and tans, with detailed scales, and are draped over her head and neck in a flowing pattern.  Dripping, dark red blood or crimson stains appear in places, adding drama and enhancing the mythological theme.  Paint is loosely applied, yet precise in details about the texture on the face, snakes, and skin tone.  The background is a soft, muted color scheme, with splashed, watercolor-like effects in browns, beiges, and grays.  The overall composition is dramatic and evocative of a mythical creature.   Heavy use of texture and shading."
