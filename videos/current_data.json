        "prompt": "An expressive ink and watercolor illustration portrays a modified cyborg in a moment of quiet contemplation. The figure is seated among smooth, dark river stones, bathed in deep, dramatic shadows. A single source of soft, cool light filters through an unseen canopy, illuminating the intricate details of their cybernetic components and their pensive human expression. The artwork is rendered in a cool-toned monochromatic palette, using varying dilutions of black ink and blue-grey washes on heavily textured paper. The composition is poetic and asymmetrical, with loose, calligraphic lines defining the form and fluid, uncontrolled drips and bleeds creating a raw, organic connection to the natural setting."
